# R-Feature-Selection
The project aims at implemeting various feature selection methodologies on a medical dataset that has around 50,000 features but around 100 data points. The dataset has various genes feature and a binary target variable. The binary variable indicates if a person is suffering from dementia. Different techniques like dimensionality reduction, fold change, t test, random forest etc. would be used to select the most discriminative features. Thereafter a classifier would be built to predict the target variable. The project has contributions from two other group members namely, Ziwei Li and Songfen Lu.
